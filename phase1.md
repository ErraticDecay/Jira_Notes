Retrieve all sprints for specified project (ex. BES)
1. Determine if:
      - Future sprint:
            - If no future sprint, create sprint with proper dates and description
  - Active sprint:
      - If no active sprint, change state on **nearest sprint** to active
  
2. Determine if completed sprints have issues assigned:
      - Move issue to active sprint

3. Ensures all issues have valid story points

4. Sends email to list of users on last day of sprint
  - Completed issues assigned to sprint
  - Pending issues assigned to sprint
